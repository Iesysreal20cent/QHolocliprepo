REPO NAME:QHolocliprepo

nothing special just a repo for code that can enable this.
LAZY PROGRAMMER OVERSEAS NIKI.just download clips fast without search in YT.
PS,very extensible.
FORGET TO ADD,but it is developed as like a daily clip retriever.
If you want the full one just edit the script.remove the maxdownload flag.

LICENSE:GPLV3.
Dislaimer,ANY financial gain IF EVER HAVE IS GONNA DIRECTLY USED ON HOLO MEM.
Plus if you have money just save it for their live or whatnot.

Usage.

paste into QHappy_UNIX/WIN_v(number?)
go into your OS labelled FOLDER.

IF UNIX.I probably do not need to teach but.
./lua Ytuserexp.lua

IF WIN

Tested known edge case.
In a veracrypt run these.YUP,does not have write permission yada,yada.
WHICH IS GOOD,in a way.secure i guess.

If the member is streaming.The stupid yt-dl will download the whole stream..
because it thought it is a small clip one by one..and then determine size.dumb.
